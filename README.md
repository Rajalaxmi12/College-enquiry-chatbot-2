📚 College Enquiry Chatbot

At its core, a chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate and process human conversation—whether through text or speech—allowing users to interact with digital systems as if they were communicating with a real person.

This project is a College Enquiry Chatbot, a virtual assistant built using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) principles. It is designed to serve as a College-Oriented Intelligence System that responds to queries related to college information and services.

🚀 Features

Provides instant responses to queries related to the college.

Assists students, faculty, and visitors with quick information retrieval.

Serves as a virtual guide for newcomers, helping them navigate college facilities, events, and policies.

Can be extended and customized to include academic details, admissions, placements, timetables, and more.

🎯 Use Cases

Students → Get information about courses, exams, results, or schedules.

Teachers → Access teaching resources, notices, or academic calendars.

Visitors/Newcomers → Quickly learn about facilities, departments, and contact points without manual intervention.

🧠 Why this Project?

College environments often involve repetitive queries such as “Where is the admissions office?”, “How do I apply?”, “What’s the fee structure?”, “Who is the HoD?”.
This chatbot automates these interactions, reducing the workload of administrative staff and improving the user experience with 24/7 assistance.
